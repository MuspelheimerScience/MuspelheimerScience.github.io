3D printed microscope with an integrated LED light!
This 3D-printed microscope is perfect for the beginner, making it easier to keep track of your project during the process and to do all the work! The 3d printer is capable of printing a variety of materials and has a 1:1 printing speed, so it's possible to print these with ease. It has an 8Ã— magnification and LED lights, which can be positioned anywhere on your 3-dimensional printed object. The LEDs are very powerful and are capable to illuminate the whole area of the printed image for an outstanding 3 dimensional look. Please contact us for a quotation for this project. We can manufacture the entire set of 3 components.

We can offer you a full set for 3 units:
LED (1)
Microscope (2) 
Probe (3) 
Light Source. 

Also, you can opt to buy a separate LED-microscope-light-source set. (4) * The Microfiber Probe is a 3.5mm diameter fiber probe that can measure fiber diameters in the range of 5 to 15 mic rons. As such, the Fiberscope can also be used for measuring the diameter of biological structures in vitro such as blood vessels and cell membranes. *The LED Light sources are a standard, commercial LED package. They are powered by a compact high output power battery.
